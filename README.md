# Fear Acquisition

Version 0.1.0

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/VBouwman/ReproWorkshop/main)

This project was made during the workshop Best Practices for Writing Reproducible Code (RDM support, UU). Data contains expectancy and fear ratings during a fear conditioning task. Only data from the acquisition phase is used in this project. In this project, .txt files generated by experiment builder E-prime (version 2.0) are read into R, are processed, and analyses are performed.

## Access 

This project can be downloaded or cloned (e.g., git clone).

## Usage

First run the read_eprime_data.R file, second the process_data.R. These generate .csv files that are used in the main_fear_acquisition.Rmd script.
